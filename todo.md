##Todo: 

1. build out handlers 
	- test handler (just prints or something)
	- Main GPIO handler class (for a switch) / Pass in items for pinlist
	- some sort of super simple programmatic handler. maybe utilizing some HTTP GET or something.
	- some sort of programmatic handler (I like the pass in time on example)

2. Code instance of these

3. Name them something fancy

4. Test

5. Test for long term period of time.
